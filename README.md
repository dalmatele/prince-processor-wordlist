Lists of tokens for prince processor attack

## Introduce
- This repo includes a lot of lists of token I'm using in prince processor attack.
- I'm using this tool to generate list of password from these lists: https://github.com/hashcat/princeprocessor
    - We don't need to seperate words to uppercase and lowercase because we can use `case-permute` option as mentioning `For each word in the wordlist that begins with a letter generate a word with the opposite case of the first letter`

## Content (Updating)
- List of Vietnamese single words
